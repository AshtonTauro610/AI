# OptiRoute AI

<br><p><strong>OptiRoute</strong> is an AI-powered solution designed to address inefficiencies in taxi driver allocation for leading 
UAE ride-hailing services such as Dubai Taxi Corporation (DTC) and Careem. Traditional dispatching 
methods often led to too many drivers hanging around in areas with few riders, while high-demand spots 
were left waiting, leading to increased fuel consumption, longer passenger wait times, higher operational 
costs, and overall reduced service quality. OptiRoute aims to resolve this by leveraging predicted ride 
demand and allocating drivers more effectively.
Thissystem uses clustering techniques like K-Means to define high-demand zones and forecast models such 
as Prophet and ARIMA to predict short-term and long-term ride demand. With this data-driven approach, 
drivers are dynamically allocated to zones based on real-time demand forecasts, maximizing resource 
utilization while reducing idle time and carbon emissions. Developed in Python with tools like Pandas, 
Scikit-learn, and Prophet, and deployed on Google Colab, the project is supported by a synthetically 
generated yet realistic dataset simulating Dubai’s urban mobility.
OptiRoute aligns with the UAE’s vision for smart, sustainable mobility by improving operational efficiency, 
reducing environmental impact, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Despite limitations like data 
availability, driver compliance, and computational constraints, the solution presents a scalable framework 
for intelligent fleet management. It demonstrates how AI can transform traditional systems into proactive, 
adaptive, and efficient models that serve both business and societal goals.</p></br>
